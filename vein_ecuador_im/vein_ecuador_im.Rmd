  A concise summary of the paper's findings on high emitters and I/M programs.
abstract: |
  Vehicular emissions are a primary contributor to urban air pollution, and inspection and maintenance (I/M) programs are key strategies to mitigate this impact. However, the effectiveness of these programs can be limited by "high emitters"—vehicles that fail emission standards but continue to circulate until their next inspection. This study quantifies and compares vehicular CO emissions in Quito, Ecuador, under two distinct scenarios using the VEIN (Vehicular Emissions Inventory) model. The first scenario assumes all vehicles comply with average emission factors, representing a baseline without explicit consideration of high emitters. The second scenario explicitly accounts for the significant contribution of high emitters that pass the annual inspection and remain in circulation. Our findings highlight the substantial difference in total emissions between these scenarios, emphasizing the critical role of undetected high emitters in inflating overall pollution levels. This understanding can inform the design of more effective I/M programs and enhance air quality management strategies in Quito and other similar urban environments.

# Introduction
ntroduction:
* Background: Discuss the significance of vehicular emissions in urban air quality, focusing on pollutants like CO. Mention the context of Quito, Ecuador, as a developing city with specific air quality challenges.
* Problem Statement: Explain that while I/M programs are designed to reduce emissions, their effectiveness can be compromised by vehicles that fail emission tests but remain in use until the next inspection. These "high emitters" can disproportionately contribute to overall pollution.
* Literature Review:
* Discuss existing literature on vehicular emission inventories and modeling, highlighting the role of the VEIN model (Ibarra-Espinosa et al., 2018).
* Review studies on the effectiveness of I/M programs globally and in Latin America.
* Cite research on the concept and impact of "high emitters" or "gross polluters."
* Research Gap: Clearly articulate that a detailed quantification of the impact of high emitters on total emissions, specifically within the context of Quito's I/M program, is lacking.
* Objectives:
* To estimate CO emissions from the gasoline vehicle fleet in Quito using the VEIN model.
* To quantify the difference in emissions between a scenario that assumes uniform emission factors (without explicit high emitters) and a scenario that accounts for high emitters that pass the annual inspection.
* To assess the potential impact of improving the detection and removal of high emitters within Quito's I/M program.
* Structure of the Paper: Briefly outline the sections of the manuscript.

# Materials and Methods:
* Study Area: Describe Quito, Ecuador, including its geographical characteristics, typical traffic patterns, and existing I/M program details (e.g., frequency of inspection, detection methods).
* Information about Ecuador's I/M program can be found in sources like SGS Ecuador and general government regulations.
* VEIN Model Description:
* Explain the VEIN R package and its suitability for creating high-resolution, street-level emission inventories.
* Detail the specific functions used from VEIN, particularly ef_whe (emission factor with high emitters) if applicable, or how you adapted the model to incorporate your high-emitter calculation.
* Mention the input data required by VEIN (e.g., vehicle fleet composition, age, fuel type, pollutant, emission type, subtype).
* Data Sources:
* Vehicle Fleet Data: Specify how you obtained data on vehicle types (e.g., gasoline cars), their distribution, age, and size in Quito.
* Emission Factors:
* Scenario 1 (Without High Emitters): Describe the average emission factors used for compliant vehicles (e.g., 0.1 g CO/km as in your example). Specify the source of these factors (e.g., standard emission databases, local studies).
* Scenario 2 (With High Emitters):
* Explain how you defined "high emitters" – e.g., a multiplier of the average emission factor (e.g., 1 g CO/km in your example).
* Detail how you determined the proportion of "approving" (normal emitters) and "reproving" (high emitters) vehicles based on the annual inspection data (e.g., 80% approval, 20% reproval).
* Explain how these proportions and factors are used to calculate the weighted emission factors (as per your example: 0.80 * 0.1 g/km + 0.20 * 1 g/km = 0.28 g/km).
* Activity Data: Describe how you obtained or estimated vehicle activity (e.g., kilometers driven per year, per vehicle type). This is crucial for converting emission factors to total emissions.
* Pollutants and Emission Types: Specify which pollutants (CO, as per your example) and emission types (e.g., exhaust) are included in the analysis.
* Methodology for High Emitter Calculation:
* Provide a detailed explanation of your approach to calculating weighted emission factors, using the provided example as a basis.
* Explain how these weighted factors are applied within the VEIN framework.
* Describe how you simulate the "circulation until measurement" aspect – i.e., that reproving vehicles continue to emit at their higher rates until their annual inspection.
* Data Analysis and Modeling:
* Describe how you integrated the calculated emission factors and activity data into VEIN to produce emission inventories for both scenarios.
* Specify the temporal and spatial resolution of your inventory (e.g., hourly, street-level).
* Comparison Metrics: Define how you will compare the two scenarios (e.g., total CO emissions, difference in emissions as a percentage, contribution of high emitters to total emissions).

# Results:
* Vehicle Fleet Characterization: Present a summary of the vehicle fleet used in the analysis for Quito (e.g., breakdown by age, type, fuel).
* Emission Factors: Show the calculated weighted emission factors for both scenarios (average vs. high-emitter accounted).
* Total CO Emissions:
* Present the estimated total CO emissions for Quito under Scenario 1 (without explicit high emitters).
* Present the estimated total CO emissions for Quito under Scenario 2 (with explicit high emitters).
* Clearly show the difference between the two scenarios.
* Contribution of High Emitters: Quantify the percentage contribution of the "reproving" (high emitter) vehicles to the total emissions in Scenario 2.
* Spatial/Temporal Distribution (Optional but Recommended): If VEIN allows, show how emissions differ spatially (e.g., hotspots) or temporally between the two scenarios.
* Statistical Significance (if applicable): If you perform any statistical tests to compare the scenarios.

# Discussion:
* Interpretation of Findings:
* Discuss the magnitude of the difference in emissions between the two scenarios. Was it as expected?
* Explain why high emitters have such a significant impact, linking it to their higher emission rates.
* Relate your findings to the effectiveness of Quito's current I/M program. Does the annual inspection adequately capture and remove high emitters?
* Implications for I/M Programs:
* Discuss how the findings inform policy decisions related to I/M programs, such as the frequency of testing, the stringency of test limits, and the enforcement mechanisms.
* Consider the potential benefits of more frequent or more sensitive emission testing.
* Discuss the economic and environmental trade-offs.
* VEIN Model Application: Comment on the utility of the VEIN model for this type of analysis, particularly its ability to handle detailed emissions calculations.
* Limitations:
* Acknowledge any limitations in the data (e.g., accuracy of fleet data, activity data, emission factors).
* Discuss the assumptions made (e.g., constant emission rates for high emitters until inspection, homogeneity of vehicle population within categories).
* Mention any simplifications in the I/M program representation.
* Comparison with Previous Studies: Place your findings in the context of existing research on vehicular emissions and I/M programs.
* Future Research: Suggest areas for further investigation (e.g., including other pollutants, different vehicle types, other cities, the impact of different I/M strategies).

# Conclusions:
* Summarize the main findings regarding the impact of high emitters on CO emissions in Quito.
* Reiterate the importance of effectively identifying and addressing high emitters in I/M programs.
* Provide a concise policy recommendation for improving air quality management in Quito based on your results.

# Introduction

The introduction should briefly place the study in a broad context and highlight
why it is important. It should define the purpose of the work and its
significance. The current state of the research field should be reviewed
carefully and key publications cited. Please highlight controversial and
diverging hypotheses when necessary. Finally, briefly mention the main aim of
the work and highlight the principal conclusions. As far as possible, please
keep the introduction comprehensible to scientists outside your particular
field of research. Citing a journal paper [@bertrand-krajewski_distribution_1998;
@leutnant_stormwater_2016]. And now citing a book reference @gujer_systems_2008.
Some MDPI journals use Chicago and others use APA, this template should choose
the correct citation format for you once you specify the journal in the YAML
header.

To use endnotes, change `endnotes: true` in the YAML header, then use
`\endnote{This is an endnote.}`.


# Materials and Methods

Materials and Methods should be described with sufficient details to allow 
others to replicate and build on published results. Please note that publication 
of your manuscript implicates that you must make all materials, data, computer 
code, and protocols associated with the publication available to readers. Please
disclose at the submission stage any restrictions on the availability of 
materials or information. New methods and protocols should be described in 
detail while well-established methods can be briefly described and appropriately
cited.

Research manuscripts reporting large datasets that are deposited in a publicly 
available database should specify where the data have been deposited and provide
the relevant accession numbers. If the accession numbers have not yet been
obtained at the time of submission, please state that they will be provided
during review. They must be provided prior to publication.

Interventionary studies involving animals or humans, and other studies require
ethical approval must list the authority that provided approval and the
corresponding ethical approval code.

# Results

This section may be divided by subheadings. It should provide a concise and
precise description of the experimental results, their interpretation as well
as the experimental conclusions that can be drawn.

## Subsection Heading Here

Subsection text here.

### Subsubsection Heading Here

Bulleted lists look like this:

* First bullet
* Second bullet
* Third bullet

Numbered lists can be added as follows:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

The text continues here.

## Figures, Tables and Schemes

All figures and tables should be cited in the main text as Figure \ref{fig:fig1}, 
\ref{tab:tab1}, etc. To get cross-reference to figure generated by R chunks 
include the `\\label{}` tag in the `fig.cap` attribute of the R chunk: 

When making tables using `kable`, it is suggested to use
the `format="latex"` and `tabl.envir="table"` arguments
to ensure table numbering and compatibility with the mdpi
document class.

```{r tab1, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(mtcars[1:5, 1:3], format = "latex", 
             booktabs = TRUE, 
             caption = "This is a table caption. Tables should be placed in the 
             main text near to the first time they are~cited.", 
             align = 'ccc', centering = FALSE,
             table.envir = "table", position = "H")
```



For a very wide table, landscape layouts are allowed.



```{r tab2, echo=FALSE}
df <- data.frame(`Title 1` = c("Entry 1", "Entry 2"),
                 `Title 2` = c("Data", "Data"),
                 `Title 3` = c("Data", "Data"),
                 `Title 4` = c("This cell has some longer content that runs over
                               two lines",
                               "Data"))
knitr::kable(df, format = "latex", 
             booktabs = TRUE, 
             caption = "This is a very wide table", 
             align = 'ccc', centering = FALSE,
             table.envir = "table", position = "H")
```

## Formatting of Mathematical Components

This is an example of an equation:

$$
a = 1.
$$

If you want numbered equations use Latex and wrap in the equation environment:

\begin{equation}
a = 1,
\end{equation}

the text following an equation need not be a new paragraph. Please punctuate 
equations as regular text.

```{comment}
If the documentclass option "submit" is chosen, please insert a blank line before and after any math environment (equation and eqnarray environments). This ensures correct linenumbering. The blank line should be removed when the documentclass option is changed to "accept" because the text following an equation should not be a new paragraph.
```

This is the example 2 of equation:

\begin{adjustwidth}{-\extralength}{0cm}
\begin{equation}
a = b + c + d + e + f + g + h + i + j + k + l + m + n + o + p + q + r + s + t + 
u + v + w + x + y + z
\end{equation}
\end{adjustwidth}

Theorem-type environments (including propositions, lemmas, corollaries etc.) 
can be formatted as follows:

Example of a theorem:

::: {.Theorem latex=true}
Example text of a theorem
:::

The text continues here. Proofs must be formatted as follows:

Example of a proof:

::: {.proof latex="[Proof of Theorem1]"}
Text of the proof. Note that the phrase ``of Theorem 1'' is optional if it is 
clear which theorem is being referred to.
:::

The text continues here.
